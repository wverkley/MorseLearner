				<P><FONT face="Arial" size="2"> Morse Learner is a small computer program to assist in 
						learning and experimenting with international morse code.&nbsp; You can use it 
						to transmit or playback morse messages, practice learning to receive morse 
						characters, practice transmitting morse characters,&nbsp;or practice receiving 
						whole words.&nbsp; Its&nbsp;emphasis is to make learning morse code easy and 
						fun.</FONT></P>

				<P>A morse mail message is simply&nbsp;some text which records the time 
					lengths&nbsp;a morse key was pressed down (+)&nbsp;and released (-) for an 
					entire morse code transmission.&nbsp; An example morse mail message looks like:</P>

				<P>This mode plays the sounds for a morse character, then waits for a small

				<P><FONT face="Arial" size="2"><STRONG><FONT face="Arial" size="2">Practice </FONT>Transmit

				<P>This mode prompts the user with a morse character, then waits for a small

					key.&nbsp; A correct answer reduces the chance of that character being prompted 
					for again, and eventually, many correct answers will unlock additional learning

						morse code for an entire word at once.&nbsp; The user can type in the answer as 
						the morse is playing,&nbsp;or&nbsp;for a short duration afterwards.&nbsp; With 
						every fully correct answer, the chance of longer words being chosen

				<P><U>Morse Speed</U></P>
				<P>The speed in which morse code is transmitted is mostly commonly measured in 
					"Words per Minute" (wpm), which is the number of times the word "PARIS" can be 
					transmitted in 60 seconds with standard timing for all the pauses between the 
					characters and words.&nbsp; Morse Learner distinguishes between character 
					speed; the speed in which individual characters are sent, and overall speed; in 
					which the pause lengths&nbsp;between characters and words 
					are&nbsp;increased&nbsp;over&nbsp;their standard lengths&nbsp;to slow down the 
					overall transmission.</P>
				<P>Morse is usually sent using standard pause lengths&nbsp;between characters and 
					words, so no distinction is normally made between the two speeds ("character 
					speed" and "overall" speed are&nbsp;the same).&nbsp; However, for learning, it 
					is useful to be able to increase the lengths between each character, so you get 
					a learn how the character sounds at&nbsp;its proper or fast transmission but 
					still have a bit more time during the pause to decypher it.&nbsp; The standard 
					"Farnsworth" speed&nbsp;for learning is 12-18 wpm for characters, and 5 wpm 
					overall.</P>
				<P>The speed setting controls how the morse is played&nbsp;and the speed in which 
					morse key input is&nbsp;read in Morse Learner.</P>
				<P>When learning morse, you will&nbsp;should set a low overall more speed (5pm), 
					and the character speed to the final speed you want to eventually become 
					familiar with.&nbsp; As your learning progresses you will slowly increase the 
					overall speed to the character speed.</P>

				<P>All the practice modes will pick characters only from the "learning character" 
					set.&nbsp; As you provide correct answers in the practice modes, the&nbsp;bar 
					for those characters&nbsp;in the display will grow smaller.&nbsp; The levels 
					can be reset to the predefined amounts; "beginner knowledge", "intermediate 
					knowledge", or "advanced knowledge", for the currently selected character set 
					through the menu.</P>
				<P>
					The practice receive characters mode and practice send characters mode will 
					automatically add new characters to this set once all the existing selected set 
					has been learnt&nbsp;roughly to an&nbsp;"advanced" level.</P>
				<P>Different characters can also be manually selected/unselected with the mouse, or

		<P><FONT face="Arial" size="2">Although Morse Learner lets the user input morse code 
				using either&nbsp;the keyboard or a mouse button, nothing beats the feel and 
				authenticity of a real morse key.&nbsp; </FONT>A morse key or paddle can be 
			connected through the serial or COM port of your computer on either the "DSR" 
			or "CTS" lines.</P>
		<P>9 pin serial cables can be brought from an electronics store, or 
			often&nbsp;obtained cheaply from old second-hand dial-up modems.&nbsp; To 
			detemine which pair of wires to connect is sometimes a matter of 
			experimentation, since the color coding of the wires is not always 
			consistent.&nbsp; One simple method is to strip all the wires, and try touching 
			different wires together until the Morse Learner program confirms a contact on 
			the right pair (make sure you turn on the com port input in the options 
			first).&nbsp; Once the correct wires are confirmed, connect the wires to the 
			morse key, and cut the rest short.</P>
		<P>Iambic morse paddles are not (yet) supported.</P>
