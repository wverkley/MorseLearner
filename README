Morse Learner is a small computer program to assist in 
learning and experimenting with international morse code.  You can use it 
to transmit or playback morse messages, practice learning to receive morse 
characters, practice transmitting morse characters, or practice receiving 
whole words.  Its emphasis is to make learning morse code easy and 
fun.

### Acknowledgements
- Harry (ab7tb) - For his excellent MorseMail program, its very elegant morse mail message format, and the community he has fostered.
- Everyone behind the open source project, [Morse Code Madness](https://sourceforge.net/projects/morsemadness/), whose code gave some valuable insights (and some synthesized voice samples which were "liberated").
- [Ward Cunningham](http://c2.com/morse/), whose own Morse Trainer is a beautifully simple program with a long lineage (and with some algorithms which seem to be directly based on old electronic circuit equivalents from old training machines) which gave me the spark to build this program.
- [Jason Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/) for his very handy Silkscreen font
